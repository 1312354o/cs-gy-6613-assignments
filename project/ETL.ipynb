       "[\"Hey everyone. Welcome to this tutorial series crash course on ROS2. If you have never used Robot operating System before, even ROS1, or if you want a practical and quick refresher of the basics, this series is for you and very quickly so you don't get confused. ROS means Robot Operating System, ROS1 is the first version of ROS and ROS2 is the second version of ROSA. ROS2 is now stable enough to be used, so this is the recommended way to start with ROS. In this series I will sometimes use the term ROS or Rust 2 and when I do I will be talking about the same thing. So the goal of this crash course is simply to get you started with Rust 2 in a very short amount of time. You will learn how to install and set up everything, how to use the main Rust 2 concepts with the command line interface and tools, and you will also Write your own Rust 2 programs with Python. In fact, throughout the series we will do together a small but complete Rust 2 application using a 2D simulation of a robot. I have designed the series so that you can really get a better understanding of the global picture and also get some practical knowledge that will be useful for your next steps with Rust 2. In this tutorial series I will target the Rust 2 humble distribution, but the concepts and most of the code will also work for other Rust 2 distributions. Now there are some prerequisites you need in order to use ros. Basically you have to be familiar with Ubuntu and the Linux command line and to write Rose code you will also need to know a bit of Python and C. But here we will stick to Python so just Python will be fine. Now this crash course is great to get you started and if you want to go further and dive into more details, concepts, projects and C code, I have also a much bigger and complete course on ROS2, so if you are interested I've put a link in the video description below and I will talk a bit more about this later on. Now let's get started with the series. In this first episode we are going to install and set up ROS262 on Ubuntu 22.04 so that in the next episode you can start using ROS functionalities. Here I am going to start from Ubuntu 22.04 that I have already installed on a virtual machine. In VirtualBox you can use either Ubuntu installed with a dual boot on your computer or in a virtual machine. It's up to you. So to install ROS2, let's first open a terminal and I'm going to put this on the side. And let's also open a web browser. I'm going to open Firefox here. Okay, and let's also put this on this side and let's search for ROS2Humble. Okay, you will get to. So let's zoom a bit here. You will get to this page on docs.rust.org okay, make sure you have a humble in the URL. If you don't have maybe you are reading the documentation for another version. So let's click on Humble here and then here you can see the table of contents. And you're going to choose Installation and click on Install Humble. All right, now you're going to choose the binary packages Installation not building from source. And you're going to go here with Ubuntu and Debian packages. And now we have the Instructions to install Rust 2 on Ubuntu. So I'm going to follow here just the instructions that we need. And just a quick note is that maybe when you browse this documentation, the instructions will have changed a tiny bit. But that's okay. It's just because, well, the documentation is quite frequently updated. So if you see something that is just a little bit different, no worries. Just follow the instructions and everything will be okay. So the first thing is we need to make sure that we have UTF 8. So we're going to type locale in the terminal here and make sure that we have UTF 8. So here it's good. If you don't have it, then you're going to just run those comments, but your passwords. Okay, so that's going to install some stuff. It's already installed for me. You run those lines here. Actually, let's put this like that. All right, so you run the four lines and then let's check local again. And of course it's okay, you have UTF 8. Now you will need to set up the sources because you can't just install ROS2 like that. You will need to set up the sources so that your computer here can find where to download Rust 2. And well, those instructions here may be removed in the future or maybe modified. So if you don't see that, don't worry and just go to the next step. But what you can do is just do this APT cache policy grep universe. And if you see stuff like that with 500 and then, well, you see Jammy and Universe stuff, then that's okay. You don't necessarily have to have the exact same thing with for example us. Here you can see I have fr, but the important thing is that you see 500 and universe. So if you don't have those, you can run those two commands here. I'm not going to run those, but you can run them if you don't have the correct lines. And now it's really the step to actually set up the sources. So you're going to run this line first to install curl and different functionalities. So here actually I already installed it before, so nothing to do for me. Then you run this line, okay? And add the repository to the sources. So you just copy and paste the line and then you are good. What you can do is now do an update. So sudo APT update this is going to update and you can see that you should have something like that packages.ros.org with ROS2 so you will have something similar. And one important thing is that before you install ROS2, let's do sudo APT upgrade to upgrade all the packages we have. So you may have a lot or not, it depends. When was the last time you actually upgraded your system? So I'm just going to put yes and wait for the upgrade. Okay, and now you can go down into the instructions. So you have a warning here, but nothing to worry about if you have correctly updated and upgraded the packages. So now everything is up to date on the system. Now you can install Rusto. So Here you have two choices. You can install ROS2 with this ROS humble desktop or ROS Humble Ros Baze. So browse base is actually. So you can see the bare bones, just the communication, the command line tools. You don't have any graphical tools and utilities. This is what you would want to have in a limited system, for example on a Raspberry PI, or if you have a computer with very low resources, or if you don't have a graphical interface, for example. But here what we want is to have the base plots, also all the utilities, some demos, some tutorials and some graphical tools. So we're going to install this. So you just do sudo apt install rosh Humble Desktop, you press enter and here. Well, I've already installed it before for this tutorial. But you will see a lot of packages. So maybe you will have a few hundreds of packages for a few hundreds of megabytes to download and a few giga to be added to your hard drive. Okay, so that's going to be allowed. So you press yes and Then you can wait for a few minutes. It's going to depend, of course, on your Internet connection speed and the performance of your computer. And right, once you have successfully installed this, then ROS2 is installed. And just a quick note here is that if you want to install any ROS2 package in the future, well, this is very simple because all the ROS2 package for the humble distribution, for example, will be ROS humble something. So you will just need to run this command sudo apt install ROS Humble the name of the package. So this is quite easy. Now, well, ROS is installed, but we can't just use it like this. We need to set up the environment. Okay, because so let's clear this. If I just do Rust 2, you will see that Rust 2 command not found. So to be able to run Rust 2, first you need to install it, which is done. And then you need to source a setup script here in every session or every terminal where you want to use ROS2. And so if we go to slash opt, you will see that this is where ROS is installed. You can go to slash, so opt Rosa and then you will see Humble. This is the distribution we just installed. So Ros Humble is actually ROS to Humble, okay? And here you see we have a setup BASH script. And this is the script that we need to source here. Okay, we need to source that. So let's go back to home directory and let's just source this script. And now that this is sourced, look at that. If I do Rust 2 now, so we have the help actually of the command. We don't have rust 2 command not found, we have the help of the command, okay, which means that this has been found and Rust 2 is correctly installed and set up. Now the thing is, let's say I open new terminal and I do rust 2 once again I have the same problem. So I need to set up the environment and now it works, okay? So I will need to set up the environment for each terminal I use. Or if you connect with ssh, for example, you will need to set up the environment for each SSH session. And so that's not really convenient. All right, so what we're going to do instead is we are going to add this line to the BASHRC file in our profile here for the user so that this line is going to be executed every time we open a new terminal or session. Okay? So to do that we are going to use Jedit and then you can do BASH SE so Tilde to go to your home directory Bash LC so this is a hidden file. Press Enter and you can see we have already a lot of lines and all this stuff is going to be executed when you open a new session or a new terminal. So you go to the very end of the file and let's add a new line here. And what do we put? We put just this one. Okay, Source opt ros Humble setup bash. Let's save the file, let's quit and let's just quit all the terminals that we have. Let's open a new terminal. And when you open the terminal, this line will be executed because it's in the bash RC. Now I can do ROS2 and you can see now it is working. So when you have Rust to with Usage Rust 2 and the help of the command, it means that Rust 2 is correctly installed and configured. And congratulations, you are now ready to start using Rust 2. All right, that's the end of this episode. If you found it useful, you will definitely like my full course on Rust 2 for beginners.

       " \"Hey and welcome back. This is episode number two of this tutorial series, Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. In the previous tutorial you have installed and set up ROS2. Now we are going to directly start a ROS2 node and understand what it is. And very Basically put a ROS2 node is simply a ROS2 program that's going to interact with Rust 2 communications and tools. Okay, so I have four terminals here and let's start a node. So where can we find a ROS2 node? Well, actually when you install the ROS2, there are some packages that are actually example packages that you can use directly to start a node without having to create one. So we're going to run Rust 2, okay? So the Rust 2 command line and then space run. And after this you will need to provide the name of a package. So the ROS2 nodes are going to be organized in packages. Okay? For example, you have a package for a camera driver, a package for a navigation of a robot, etc. In each package you can have different programs or nodes. So here the package we want is called demonodes and you can press tab here and you can see we have auto completion. So if I press tab twice I get this auto completion and I have several choices. I'm going to choose Demo nodes CPP and then I press space again and now I need to provide the name of the node. We are going to go with a node that's name is torquer. So Rust 2 run demo CPP talker. Then you are going to press Enter and you can see we have something. So the node is running. So that's a program that's running and you can see it is printing stuff. Now you can press Control C to kill the node. And just one quick note is that if you don't have this, but if you have ROS2 command not found, it's because you have not correctly set up the environment after installing ROS2. So in this case make sure. So let's go to. So let's do Jedit bash rc. So let's go to the bash RC file. Let's go to the bottom and at the bottom you should have this line, okay, Source Opt Ross Humble setup bash and now let's come back to the node. So what you see here on the screen are logs from the node. And this node is named Torquer. Here you can see the timestamp and this is what's coming from the node. So that's simply a program that's going to print publishing. Hello world with a counter. So let's run this node again. Now we have running node. Now in this terminal, let's do Clear and let's do ROS2 run Demonodes CPP. So I'm going to use the same package. And in this package we have other nodes. For example, we have Listener. So Listener, okay, like that I can press Enter and look what's here. I heard hello World 22, and that's exactly what is written here. Okay, so I have one node here, one node here. Let's do RQT graph in another terminal. So what is RQT graph? RQT Graph is a tool. This is a ROS tool that you can use to actually see the graph. So what is the graph? Let's run it and okay, let's put it full screen and let's do refresh here. So what is the graph? The graph is simply the representation of all the nodes that are running. And so you can see that here we have one node called Talker, which is the first node we have studied, and one node called Listener, which is the second node we have started. And this is actually a topic. So we are going to come back to topic later in this crash course. But what you can see here is that this node is talking to that node. So the node here, Talker, is sending some information to the node Listener. And that's what we can see here. You can see that what's being sent here is received by this program. Okay, let's say I kill the token node. Okay, you can see the Listener node, I press Enter here is still working. It's still waiting for stuff to receive. When I start again, you can see Publishing, hello, 1, 2, let's kill it. And you can see here I heard hello world 1, 2 and 3. So with this example here, you can see that a node well is simply a program that you're going to run. So it can be any program, it can be a C program, a Python program, and the specificity of that program is that it's connected to the Rust 2 environment. So in this case, the node here named Tocquer is going to send some messages using Rust 2 communications. And this node named Listener is going to receive Messages also using Rust 2 communications. You can note also that the logs here are handled by ros. So nodes are also using tools like logging. And also when we launched the RQT graph, which is a visual tool, you can also debug the nodes. So a node well, basically It's a program that's going to use Rust 2 functionalities. Now let's stop everything. So let's do clear and let's stop the RQT graph too. Okay, let's clear this and let's also stop with Control C and click. So now we have nothing running. So actually if I do RQT graph you can see. So I can refresh here. Well, we have nothing because there is no node currently running. I'm going to use a second example. We are going to run. So Rust two run. So that's the same command. Now we are going to go in the turtle sim package. So turtlesim is a great package to start experimenting with robots in two dimensions. And so from turtlesim we are going to go with turtlesimnode. So name of the package? Turtlesim. Name of the node turtlesim node I press Enter. And what do we have? Oh, you can see we have a window, so graphical window that's blue and inside we have a turtle. If I go back to RQT graph, let's refresh. You can see we have a node called Turtle Sim. That's the node we have studied here. And this node. Well, the previous nodes we have studied were just nodes that were interacting with the terminal, sending logs and messages. Here you can see this node is also creating a graphical interface. Now let's start. So I'm going to actually make it here. So change the layout a bit and keep the turtle here in this terminal. Let's do Rust to run Turtle sim. So still in turtlesim package we're going to do turtleteleop key. So I press tab here and let's press enter. This node here is going to listen to what you type on the keyboard. You can see here reading from keyboard. So this is going to listen to what you type and then let's see what it's going to do. So for example, I'm going to use the arrows of the keyboard, so the up arrow. And you can see that the turtle here has moved. If I use the left, okay, it's turning up, down, right. You can see I can make the turtle navigate. Okay, and so what's happening here? Well, we have one node here that's responsible for creating a graphical interface with a turtle. And then we have one node here. So that's another program that's responsible for reading from the keyboard and then as we can guess, sending some command to that other node. Okay, so this one will be sending comments. This one will be receiving and executing the comments. Now if we go back to the RQT graph. Let's refresh. And let's keep the nodes only here. You can see now. So we have two nodes. We have the turtlesim node and the teleop turtle node. So we have two programs running on the ROS graph. And when we have different communications here, but you can see there is one going from the telop turtle to the turtlesim. This is the Turtle one command velocity. That's a topic. And again, we're going to see topics later in the course. But you can see basically what's happening. This program is going to send commands to that program. All right? And that's exactly what's happening. And make sure, okay, that when you want to make the turtle move, you have to actually select this terminal with the turtle teleop key, okay. So that when you use the keyboard, you can see the turtle is moving. If you select another terminal, well, you're not going to be able to move the turtle. You have to select that one. All right? And that's pretty much it for now. So what is a node? Well, a node is basically any program that also has access to ROS functionalities and ROS communications. We have seen that with nodes that just communicate between each other and that print logs on the terminal. You can also have nodes that create graphical interface nodes that interact with the hardware nodes that also, for example, host a web server or call a web server. Well, anything. And now congratulations, because you've already seen a lot of things with ROS2 nodes, also with the command line. So you have an introduction to command line and some ROS tools like Acutigraph. From the next tutorial, we are going to see how to create your own ROS2 nodes so you can create your own custom Rust 2 programs. All right, that's the end of this episode.

       " \"Hey and welcome back. This is episode number three of this tutorial series, Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. So let's start to write some code. But actually, before we even write code, we need to do a bit of organization because we need to create a Rust to workspace. You are not going to create your code wherever, okay? We need a bit of organization. So you are going to create a Rust to workspace in this Rust 2 workspace. You will organize your code through different packages and you will also be able to build and install your custom code in your workspace so that you can actually use it. Also, if you work with a team, for example, and if you need to share code, well, that's what you are going to share. You are going to share a specific Rust workspace with many nodes inside, so you can easily collaborate. All right, so the first thing we are going to do is we are going to install the build tool for Rust. Because as I told you, this Rust to workspace you're going to write code, but you're also going to build your code and build your rust to nodes. And what is the build tool for Rust 2? The build tool is named CallCon. So let's just install that sudo apt so we can do sudo apt update, maybe put the password. Okay? And then we can do sudo apt install. That's going to be Python 3 Qualcon common extensions. So just like that. And you can use the autocompletion as well. So let's press enter, okay? And let's just install that. So yes, and let's wait a bit. Okay, great. And now it's as simple as this. Codcon is installed and we can use it. There is just one more thing I'm going to show you now is because if you just use col like this, so that's going to be a command line tool, you will not be able to use the auto completion for the different options of the command line. So we need to do something more to enable that. Let's do clear here. And let's go to so CD user so usr share and then call con. So callcon arg complete. So you should have this now and then hook and in here you can see we have a bash script and that's going to be very similar to what we did with the environment setup for Rust 2. We're going to need to source this bash script so that we can use the autocompletion for qualcon Arguments. And instead of sourcing this script every time we open a new terminal, I am simply going to do Jedit here, bash lc. So let's open this and let's put that on the side. All right, we are going to do source. So after the line to source the rust to installation, I am going to add another line source with this. So the path here, right there. User share callcon rcomplete Hook this script right there. Okay, so we can make sure that this is going to be sourced every time we open a terminal or a session. Let's save the bash RC and quit. Now let's go back to our home directory and here either you open new terminals or you can just do source bash SC so you can make sure that the changes have been made. And let's also source every terminal we have for now. Source. So bash SC here and source BASH sc. Okay, so callcon is installed and we can also use auto completion in all terminals that we have. Plus any new terminal that we open will be already correctly configured. Great. Now we have cold call and the auto completion. Let's go back to creating our workspace. And so what is a ROS2 workspace? Well, nothing more than a folder actually. So I am in my home directory. I'm just going to do mkdir. I'm going to name it Rust2/WS. So that name is actually quite common. That's something you're going to see quite often as a ROS to workspace. You can use any name you want, actually. But I'm going to keep this one for this tutorial. So I press Enter and then let's go to this ROS2 workspace. So now we will need to configure this and to actually say that this is a workspace. So for now it's empty. We are going to create so MKDIR src we're going to create a source folder that should be named exactly src. Okay, so now you have Rust 2 workspace and inside src folder. So in this src, that's where you actually are going to write your Rust 2 node. And how is it going to work? Well, you already have a Rust 2 Global installation, so you are going to be able to use the functionalities and the nodes from the Rust to global installations and also Your own custom Rust 2 nodes on top of this global installation. So we can also call this workspace an overlay. Okay, that's going to be an overlay on top of your ROS2 global installation. All right. And now, well, what we can do here by going to this ROS2 workspace, not in the source, but in this ROS2 workspace directory, we can do cold call space build. You press enter and you can see, well, zero packages finished because we have nothing in the source directory. But the build has been successful. If I do ls, you can see now we have three new folders. We have build, Install and Log. So Qualcomm is going to fetch the code that is inside the source folder and then it's going to do stuff. It's going to build and it's going to install nodes inside the install folder. And if we go to install here, you can see that we have actually another setup BASH script. And what do we need to do? Well, we will actually need to source this setup bash script if we want to be able to use our custom ROS2 nodes. Okay, so once again I'm going to go back. So let's say here jedit bash RC and we are going to need to do so let's say I'm here in the home directory, I can do source tilde ROS to workspace, install setup bash. After I do this, I can use the nodes that I have created. And so this line, I am actually going to copy it and add it after the last line of the Bash RC right here. So now in the Bash SE I have three lines. One line to set up the global ROS2 installation in the environment, one line for the Qualcon autocompletion, and one line for the custom ROS2 workspace that we have created. So now I save and either you can source the BASH SE in so actually not cheated, but you can source the BASH SE in your terminal so that it's going to be able to find your custom Rust workspace, or you can just open new terminals. And using this Rust 2 workspace, you are now ready to start creating a Rust 2 application. All right, that's the end of this episode. If you found it useful, you will definitely like my full course on Rust 2 for beginners. This course contains more than 10 hours of content and will teach you everything you need to create complete Rust 2 applications. You can find the link in the description. Thank you for watching.

       " \"Hi and welcome back. This is episode number four of this tutorial series, Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. So you now have a ROS2 workspace which is correctly configured and where you will be able to write your code. But there is just one more thing we need to do before we can start. Actually to write a node, we need to create a package. So let's go to our Rust 2 workspace in the source source directory. We have nothing for now and we will actually write nodes inside packages. Okay. So packages will allow us to organize the code in a better way. Also better organize the dependencies between packages. So let's see how to create a package. To create a package. Well, first you go to the source directory of your workspace and you do ROS2PKG and then create. Okay, ROS2PKG create and then the name of the package. Let's go with my underscore robot controller. Make sure you don't use spaces. Okay. If you want to have different words, use underscores. And so why do I name the package like that? Well, we're going to control. So if you remember the Turtle sim robot in 2D that we have tried before, we are going to create a package and inside we are going to to write some nodes to control this stutter. So that's going to be a robot controller package. And why do I name it like this? Well, we are going to experiment with some nodes inside this package. And actually the final project of this crash course is to control a robot. So I'm just naming it controller and I just put my robot. This is something that is quite common, is that if you create a package for a robot, you're going to put the robot name first and then what you want to do. So for example, it can be a controller, can be a camera driver, a navigation package, etc. And if your robot is named, let's say C3PO, then you're going to have for example, C3PO controller. That's a good practice to have. And then each package is going to be one subpart of your application. And the package can contain many nodes. Each node will be specific to this subpart. So here, if I have a robot controller, each node will be specific to the control of the robot. If I have a camera package, each node will be specific to the camera functionality. And then of course between packages you can have dependency. You can say that package A depends on package B depends on package, C, etc. So what do we have for now? ROS2PKG. Create name of the package. Now we will need to specify if this is a Python package or a C package. Okay? So either we are going to write Python nodes or C nodes. And for this one I'm going to go with Python. So you do dash, dash, build, type, like this, and then you're going to need to provide a score. And here I'm going to press tab, okay? Not enter. I'm going to press tab twice. And you can see we have two choices. We have ament cmake and ament Python. We're going to go with Ament Python. So what is ament? Ament is the build system. Okay? Corn is the build tool that we have installed and that's going to use the build system named aement. So a Python for a Python package. Ament cmake for a C package. Great. So now we have a name, we have the build type, and I'm going to add dependencies. So dependencies, and the dependencies are basically other packages and functionalities that we are going to need to use in this package. And so here I'm just going to write RCLPI. Okay, what is RCL PY? We're going to see that when we write the node. Actually, this is the Python library for Rust. So because we're going to write Python code, we need of course to use the Python library. And so that's why I added here as a dependency and more on that later in the crash course. So now I can press enter and you can see we have some logs with a lot of stuff, but let's actually just see. So let's do clear and let's see what we have. You can see we have a new folder named My Robot Controller. And to navigate inside this, let's actually use Visual Studio code. Or you can use any text editor you want. But I'm going to use Visual Studio code. So to install it, let's do sudo snap Install code. Classic. Okay, so now I have Visual Studio code. That was just the line to show you how to install it on Ubuntu. And also in the following tutorials, I'm going to show you how to configure Visual Studio code to run with Rust tool. So you can write nodes with auto completion and everything. But for now let's just come back to this package and let's do code dot INSIDE the source directory of the workspace. Okay, so do I trust. Yes, I trust the authors, because that's Me. Okay, and this is what we have here in Vs code. So you have the source folder and inside we have My Robot controller. So if I click I expand and this is what I have in the package My robot controller. So everything here has been generated automatically. So let's do a quick tour of that. So first let's go to package XML. This file will be in every ROS2 package. So that's an XML file, as you can see, and it contains the name of the package. You can also precise a version number, a description, also your email if you are a maintainer and you are publishing the code and the license. Okay, so all of that will be useful if you decide to publish your package. So for example, if you want to publish on GitHub or in the official Rust repository, you will need to fill those informations. Then we have here you can see the dependencies and we have depend with RCL PI. This is what we have provided as a dependency in the command line. So anytime your package so anytime the My robot controller package depends on another package, you're going to add another depend line here just after that one. Then we have some more stuff and you can see we have also a python for the build type. So that's a python package. Then we have Setup CFG this file. You're not going to touch it. It's just to help Rust to know where are going to be installed the nodes and then setup py and here you have things that are similar to the package xml. For example, the name, the version, the maintenance, the email, the description, the license. Okay, and we are going to come back to this because actually in the entry points, that's where we're going to precise where actually to install the ROS2 nodes. But more on that later. Okay, so you have different configuration files here. Then you have a test folder. We're not going to go into that for now. The resource folder. Okay, Just leave it like this. And we have this folder myrobotcontroller. So actually this folder will be the same name as your package name. Okay. That's always going to be the same name and that's very important. And inside you have an init python and that's actually inside this folder that we are going to create our ROS2 nodes. Okay, now let's come back to the terminal and let's go back one folder back to the ROS2 workspace folder. Okay, very important to go to this folder. Exactly. And we are going to build this package. So let's do colcon build Press Enter. Okay, and you might see this. Okay, so maybe the build will be successful. In this case you can just skip a few seconds of the tutorial. But maybe you will also have an error like that. And this is because of the setup tool Python package that's not working correctly here. So I'm just going to show you now how to fix that. So let's go into that terminal and let's use pip3. Let's do list and well, if you don't have pip3, you can do sudo apt install python3 pip. Okay, let's install it. Okay, now let's do pip3 list for all the packages. And actually let's do Pipe Grip Setup Tools. And you can see that here I have Setup Tools package with version, that's the version number here. 59.6.0. So if things are working correctly here, you don't need to change anything for this package. But if things are not working correctly, we will need to actually downgrade the version to the 58.2.0. So how to do that? Pip3 install setup tools = with 58.2.0. Let's press enter. Okay, downloading, installing and then let's go back to this command. Pip3list grep setup tools. We have 58.2.0. So we have changed the version for the package. And now let's go back here. Let's do callcon build and it should work. Okay, it's working correctly. You can see here CallCon build successful and one package finished, which is the My Robot Controller. All right, so once you see this success message, everything that's inside the package has been built. So for now we have no nodes. But if you see in the install folder, you can see we have a My Robot Controller folder already. And so what's going to happen when you do callcon build? Well, it's going to fetch all the nodes and stuff that you want to install from this package and it's going to install it inside the install Folder of the Rust 2 workspace. And then from there you will be able to use Rust 2 command line tools, for example, with Rust to run that we have seen before to start your own nodes. All right, so now we have fully ready to write some nodes. We have a Rust workspace that is correctly configured. We have also a package that is configured and we can start to write a Rust 2 node with Python in the next tutorial. Alright, that's the end of this episode. If you found it useful, you will definitely like my full course on Rust 2 for beginners. This course contains more than 10 hours of content and will teach you everything you need to create complete Rust 2 applications. You can find a link in the description. Thank you for watching. See you in the course or in the next tutorial of the series.\",\n",
       " \"Welcome back. This is episode number five of this tutorial series Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. Now let's write our first node. This will be kind of a hello world node so that you can get familiar with how to write your own node, how to start it, and how to use the command line tools to introspect the node. And after this node we are going to start our Turtle controller project. So where to create a node? Let's go back to our Rust 2 workspace. Here in the source folder we have my robot controller package. So we go inside the package and now this package is actually a python package. So we have specified that when we created the package. So we are going to go in the folder which name is the same as the package name. So let's go to my robot controller. Okay, so we are in my robot controller, in my robot controller, in the source of Rust workspace. This one will contain only init py. We just leave this here and we are going to create a new Python file with touch. Let's call this my first node py. We just create a file like this and let's make it executable with ChMode +X, my first node. So now it should be green here in Ubuntu Terminal. All right, so that's the first step is to create a python file and make it executable. Then let's go back to our source folder of the workspace and let's open Visual Studio code here. So I'm going to do code dot. Okay, and we are in my robot controller package. So we are in the source here, the source folder and we have my robot controller. We have just one package for now, if I open this, and if I open this one, I will see my first node py and I can start to edit the file. So let's add the interpreter line. So like this user bin and Python 3. Okay, so that's interpreter line to tell the interpreter to use Python 3. And then I am going to import sclpy. Okay, sclpy is the Python library for Rust 2, so we will need to import it every time we want to create a Rust to node with Python. Now the thing is that, well, you can see sclpy is not recognized. We don't have auto completion. So if we want to have auto completion with Visual Studio code and have some nice functional it is on top of that we can go. So let's just save the file here and we can Go to this here extensions and I am going to search for the ROS extension. So it says do you want to install Python? Let's just ignore that for now and let's search for ROS and find the one with the Microsoft. Okay, so the ROS extension will actually work for ROS1 and for ROS2, okay. And that's the one we're going to install. So let's click on install. Okay? And now it should be good. So let's go back actually to the extensions and let's see what we have installed. So as you can see, now we have different extensions that are installed. So we have ros. We also have Python, okay, which was installed with the ROS one. Okay. We also have C. So if you want to write code with Visual Studio code and do Python and C, you just install the ROS extension that's going to install Python C and everything you need. So now we don't need to worry about it anymore. So you can see now RCLPI is recognized and we will have auto completion for all the features in rclpy. Great. And maybe you need to restart VS code. Depends here. I don't need to, so I'm just going to continue like this. Now what I will do is I will create a main function so def main and I'm going to put args is equal to none. So I'm going to allow this main function to receive some arguments and by default I put them to none. Okay, let's just put pass for now. We're going to fill this function later and then let's do if name is equal to main and let's call the main function. Okay, so this is going to be useful when we want to directly execute the file from the terminal, for example, by just running the Python script and having a main function just like that will be useful when we want to install the node with Rust 2 functionalities. So what do we want to do in the main function? Well, the first thing to do is to initialize Rust2 communications. So to do that we do LCL py.insit and like that we can pass. Args is equal to args. So the args parameter of the init function equals the args that we get from the main. And so this is going to be the first line in your main. We initialize sclpy or Basically we initialize ROS2 communications. The last line is going to be SCL PI shutdown, all right? And everything you will write will be actually here. So first line SCLPY init last line SCLPY shutdown so that you start Rust 2 communications and you shut down Rust 2 communications. And in between we will be able to create a node. So the node is actually not the file itself is actually not the program itself. The node will be created in inside the program. And so for now, of course, we're going to create just one node per program. But as you get More advanced with Rust 2, you will see that you can actually run multiple nodes from within the same program. All right, so let's just start with the first node now. And actually in Rust 2, the way to create nodes is to use object oriented programming. So we are going to create the node actually outside of the main Here we are going to create a class and this class will actually inherit from the node class of lclpy. So we need to do from sclpy node import node and then we can create, let's say mynode. So that's going to be the name of the class. Open, close, parenthesis and we put node and then column. So by doing this, we define a class mynode which inherits from the node that is from lclpy node. Why we do this? So that our class can already have access to all the functionalities of rustwo. Now, in this class, the first thing to do is to create a constructor. So def init like this with self. And the first line in the constructor is going to be super. Okay, we're going to call the constructor of the upper class. So the constructor of the node class here. So super open, close parenthesis. Init open close parenthesis. And here we are going to provide the node name that we want to have. So this one is the node class. Okay? It's just for programmatical purpose. That's the node class we're going to use in the program. But this is the node's name that's going to be used when we actually run the node in the graph. Okay, so let's call it, let's say first node. Okay, I'm using on purpose, I'm using a different name for the node's name and the files name. Okay, Just to show you as an example, and I'm gonna come back to this just a bit later. So by doing this, we have initialized the node and that's the minimum you need to do to create a node. Create a class, a constructor. You call super and you give the node's name. Now let's go back to our main here. So what do we want to do. Well, just after we initialize ROS2 communications, let's actually create the node. So let's just do node is equal to my node and what? In the constructor we don't have any parameters. So nothing in the parenthesis here you can add as many parameters. You can just do whatever you want. Okay, that's a class, so you can customize it as you want. For now we have nothing, just self. Okay, so we do node is equal to my node and then we have created the node inside the main. So what's going to happen here? We initialize Rust 2 communications and Rust 2 features. We create a node that's actually inherited from the node class of rclpy and then we're going to run some stuff, and then at the end, RCLPY shutdown, which is going to also destroy the node and everything inside the node and shut down all ROS2 communications. Now I am going to come back to this constructor and I'm just going to add one line so that the node can actually do something. Because if we run like this, nothing's going to happen. So let's do self dot get logger. Okay? So self will actually get the functionalities of the node class. Okay, so inside this we have get logger dot, let's say info and then let's say hello from Rusto. All right, so that's the way to write log with Rust. From within a class, you do self.getlogger.info and some text. Let's save this. And now let's go back to the terminal. Maybe on that. On that one, let's go to ROS2 workspace source. My robot controller. My robot controller. We have the file. Let's run it. My first node. Okay, you can see hello from Rust. We have a log with info level. The timestamp first node is the name of the node as defined here. Okay, and then we have hello from Rust. All right, so that's working. And we have run our first node, okay, so actually what we have run is a Python script that we have set as an executable. So we have run a Python executable, and in that execute table, we initialize rustwo, we create a node, we do stuff with the node, and then we shut down Rust 2. Now, as you can see, when I run the node, we have something printed and then we directly exit from the node. But if you remember, when we have started a few nodes previously, well, the node was continuously running and we had to press CTRL C to kill the Node here, once again, you can see the node directly exits. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna add, after creating the node and of course before the shutdown, I'm going to do sclpy spin and pass the node as a parameter. Okay, what is that? So what is the spin functionality in ROS2? Well, when you make a node spin, basically what it means is that this node is going to be kept alive, so it's going to continue to run indefinitely until you actually kill it with control C, for example, and while it is alive, all the callbacks of the node. So we're going to see later how to create callbacks for the node, so all the callbacks will be able to be run. So basically we keep the node alive so that it can continue to run and to communicate with ROS2 functionalities until we want to kill the node. And when we kill the node with control C, this is going to return and then we can do LCL PY shutdown, which is going to destroy the node here, the class and everything, and shut down ROS2 communication. So let's save this and let's go back to the terminal. Let's run it again. You can see hello from ROS2, but now we are still. You can see the node is still running. Okay, I can press enter. We are still in node. Now I press Ctrl C and you can see the node is killed. So we have this exception, which is not really a problem. Okay, don't worry about this, about the keyboard interrupted. It's not a problem. But you can see here that now the node is alive and we have to kill it with Control C so that it stops. All right, let's come back to the node now. Well, we have run the node from the terminal as a Python script, but that's not what you want to do later. What you want to do is to be able to run it with the Rust 2 functionalities, for example, with rust, to run like we have seen before. So how to do that we will need to. Well, actually, to install the node. How to install the node? Well, that's very easy. You go to setup PY of your package. Okay, so my first node is in this package. I'm going to go to the setup PY. In setup PY here I have entry points with console scripts. I'm going to go inside the array of console script, press Enter, add some quotes. And now what I will do is I will create an executable name. Okay, so for example, test node and then is equal To I will need to put my robot controller. So package name. File name, my first node, my first node without the Python extension. And then colon main, which is actually the function we want to run. So if I go here, I have a main function. That's the one I'm going to provide here. Okay, so test node, this is going to become the Rust 2 executable is equal to package filename colon function we want to run. I am saving with control S. And now let's go back to the terminal and we are in our rust workspace in the source folder. I'm going to come back to the rust to workspace here where we have the build, install, log and source. And I'm going to do callcon build. Let's press Enter. Okay, and you can see now the package has been built. And now this is very important. After you have built the package, if you want to use new functionalities that you have developed in the package, you need to source your environment again. Okay, you need to source your workspace. How to source the workspace? You can do source BASH LC because all the source lines have been put in the bash lc. So source bash lc. Okay, and now we can do rust 2 run my. So let's use auto completion. My robot controller. If I press tab here we have test node. So as you can see my robot controller, this is the package test node. This is the node that we have created. I press enter and you can see we have the node here. Hello from ROS2 still alive. And now I can press Ctrl C to kill the node. So now I'm going to come back to the names here that are very important. So myrobotcontroller the oil. This is the package name. But then you can see we have. So we have test node here we have used Testnode, which is the Rust 2 executable. Then we have the file name which I have named myfirstnode. And we have the node's name, which is firstnode. So make sure you make the difference between the three. We have the node's name inside ROS functionalities, we have the file name where you're going to write your code. And we have the executable name, which is the one that's going to be installed with Qualcomm Build and the one that you are going to run. Okay, you can see here test node with the command line tool. Okay, so executable name and then file name and then node name, three different things. If you want, you can use the same name for all of them. For the executable, the file name and the node name. Okay, that's what I'm going to use in the future, actually. But here I am making it different so that you can see that there are three different things. And now a quick tip I'm going to show you that's going to help you to develop faster with Python. So the thing is, every time you're going to change your Python code, you will need to actually build again. Okay, with callcon build and then you will be able to run the updated version of the node. But with Python, you know that actually Python is an interpreted language. So that would be nice if we could actually skip the building part when we want to run a new version of the Python script and how to do that. So let's first just. I'm going to just change the log here. Okay, just print ROS2 just to show you. Let's go back to the terminal. And now if I run the node again, well, you can see we have hello from Rust 2. So this is still the old version. Okay, you can see now the code says Rust 2, but we are still having hello from ROS2. So how to fix that? Let's clear here. I am still in the Rust workspace. I can do callcon build with SIMLINK install. So symlink install. And you can see I can have the auto completion. So if you don't have the auto completion, make sure that you have correctly followed the installation steps when we created the Rust to workspace. When I do this. Okay, let's source the bash. Now let's do ROS2. Run my robot controller with test node. Okay, we have ROS2, which is well, quite expected because anyway, we have built the package again, but now I'm gonna just remove the two. For example, I save. And now let's run again. And you can see we have ROS. So we had ROS 2, now we have ROS. We haven't built the package again, but because of the symlink install option, what's going to happen is that you will be able to directly execute the new version of your script without having to install it or to build it every time. All right, so that's quite convenient. And note that if you have some errors here, maybe you will also need to source. So when you want to modify the script, after you modify the script, you also source the BASH SE and then run the node. Okay. Just in case if you have any problem. All right, now let's come back to the node and actually let's make this a bit more interesting. So this node for now does well, pretty much nothing. It just prints something and that's it. And then wait, with the spin, I'm going to create a very common structure that we are going to use in the following of this crash course and that you are going to use also all the time. So what we want to do here, let's say we want to print a message every second. For that we are going to use a ROS to timer and a ROS to callback. So the principle is simple. We create a timer inside the node that's going to say every one second I'm going to call this function and this function is going to do something. So let's create actually dev timer callback with self. So we create a timer callback inside the node, very important, inside the node with the correct indentation. And here we do self get logger and let's say hello. So nothing very special. We just create a function that prints hello, so actually not getlogger hello, but getlogger.info with hello and here. Well, let's remove this line and let's do self dot create timer. Okay, so you have another function inside the node that is create timer. Now you need to give a timer period in seconds and that's a float number. So let's do 1.0 and then a callback self dot timer callback without the parenthesis. Okay, Here just the name of the function and that's pretty much it. Let's just run this. So save and run. Let's see what it does. Hello, you can see hello, hello, hello, etc. Every one second you have hello. So what happened here is that. Well, we first initialize ROS2 and then we create a node in the constructor. So we set up the node with a name. We create a timer that's going to call the timer callback every one second. So until now nothing happens. But then we call lclpy spin with the node. So the node is going to be kept alive and spin actually will enable all the callbacks for the node. So that's where it is super important is that this Timer is a ROS2 functionality that's going to call a callback. This callback will be enabled because of the spin. So the spin will make sure that this node will execute all its callbacks. And so every second this is going to be called and we can print hello, we can also. So let's say for example, we add here self counter. I'm going to use Underscore the end for attributes of the class is equal to. Let's put 0 and then let's put hello + str self counter like that. So we're gonna print the counter and then do self dot counter plus one. Okay, so the ID is to print hello 0, hello 1, etc. I save. Let's run again. Okay, hello 0, hello 1, hello to hello 3, etc. Well, now let's run it again and let's run here. Let's do clear. Let's run acuity graph. Okay, let's refresh. You can see now we have. So we have first node. Okay, that's the node that we have actually defined here. This is the first node that's running. Okay, so we can see it with rqt graph for now. Well, there is just one node. There is nothing else. And this node is not communicating with any other node. So that's just one node here. And I'm going to show you another command because you have seen so you have seen the Rust to run command to start a node. But then you can also use CD here. You can also use Rust to node. So the rust to node comment will allow you to introspect your nodes. You can do ROS2 node list. You can see I have first node. You can do ROS2 node info with the name of the node. Okay, that's going to give you some information that we're going to see actually later. All right, you have now created your first node and used a few of the most important Rust 2 functionalities such as logging, timers, callbacks, spin, etc. You can also start your node and introspect your ROS graph. Alright, that's the end of this episode. If you found it useful, you will definitely like my full course on Rust 2 for beginners.

       " \"Welcome back to episode number six of this tutorial series Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. Now we are going to start focusing on ROS2 communications with topics. You have seen what are nodes and how to create nodes. Now let's see how nodes communicate between each other with topics. And to do that let's simply start some nodes and I'm going to explain to you along the way. So let's do ROS to run demonodes cpp. Let's start the token node. So this node will, as you can see, write some logs on the terminal and say publishing hello world with a number in this terminal. Let's do rust to run demo nodes CPP listener listener. And as you can see here, it's quite obvious that what's being sent actually what's being published here, hello World 25 is received by the listener note. Okay, in this terminal I'm going to do acuity graph, okay, and you can refresh, you can put nodes only or maybe notes topics all you can have the view like this. And what do we have here? Well, as you can see, we have the node poker, we have the node listener. So nothing new. And we have this vox slash chatter. What is chatter? Well, chatter is actually a topic. And so what's a topic? Well, it's simply a way to communicate between nodes. Okay, you will have nodes that are going to publish. So the talker node is going to publish on the chatter topic and the listener node is going to subscribe to the chatter topic. Okay, so in order to make one node communicate with another one, by just sending data from one to the other one, you're going to use a topic. So the talker is actually not talking directly to the listener. The talker is publishing to chatter and the listener is subscribing to chatter. So in the end, this data that is being sent from the talker node is going to be received by the listener. But going through this topic, okay, let's come back to the terminal and actually let's use some more command line tool. So ROS2, you have seen ROS to run, you have seen ROS to node. Actually you can do ROS2 topic with list. And you can see we have the topic chatter. I can do ROS2 topic info chatter. And you can see we have the type, we have one publisher, we have one subscriber. Okay, so the publisher is going to be actually this one, the talker, the subscriber is the listener. Now I can do ROS2. So this type is actually what is being sent, okay, because there is the topic name, which is chatter. But then there is also kind of a data type that you need to respect when you publish or when you subscribe. So you can do rust to interface. That's going to be called an interface show with this. And you can see that in this we have some comments and you have string data. So what's being sent between the talker and this listener is actually a message called so STD messagestring which contains the data of type string. Now let's kill this and let's kill this. So you can see with command line tools you can actually introspect and see what's going on in your graph. You can use the ROS2 topic to see in the terminal. You can use also RQT graph to have a visual representation. Now you can also listen to what's being sent to a topic directly from the terminal. So let's say you run the talker, just the talker, the listener is not running. Let's do here ROS2 topic/chatter. So now we know the name of the topic because that's the one we have found here. Okay, let's press enter here. And you can see we Receive data hello world 17 here, etc etc. And the data is here because that's actually the data type here. So the data type. So the interface is actually of type string. And the name of the message is data. So we receive data with hello world something. What's happening in the subscriber of the listener is that the message is going to be processed. So we don't have data, we just have the string here. So I can also run the listener and you can see here we receive the message in this terminal and in that terminal. Okay, so I can show you that with ROS topic info, we have one publisher and we have two subscribers. If I do RQT graph again, let's refresh and let's also uncheck the debug. So don't worry about this and that. What you can see now is that we have the topic chatter, we have one publisher and we have two subscribers. We have the listener node, and we have a node that's actually being created when we create subscribers, when we actually use the rostopic comment, that's going to create a subscriber just in that terminal. Okay, so you can see that we can have many subscribers for one topic and we could also have many publishers for one topic. And so all the publishers are going to publish to this and all the data is going to be sent to all the subscribers. So this subscriber is going to receive the same thing as this subscriber. For example, now if I, let's say kill this one, I go back to rqtgraph. I refresh. You can see now we don't have this node anymore. We just have the listener. I'm going to remove debug. Okay, now, okay, that was the first example. Let's use another example. So let's clear this. Let's come back to the turtlesim. So rust 2 run turtlesim with turtlesim node. Okay, so we have the turtlesim. Let's put that actually on the side. And in this one, let's do ROS2 Run Turtle Sim. And what do we have? We can also run the turtle teleop key. Okay, and with this, if I select this terminal and I press the arrows of the keyboard, I can make the turtle move. Okay, now here, let's do acut graph. Let's actually refresh. And okay, you have group two. Let's go to zero. Okay, so that the view is going to be maybe a bit more simplified. So what do we have here? We have two nodes. We have the turtlesim node and we have the teleop turtle node. And so what's happening? What's happening is that you can see that what we have in this node. So with the turtle teleop key node is going to be sent to the turtlesim node, okay? Because when we actually press the keys on the keyboard in this terminal, the turtle is moving, but the turtle is handled by this program. Okay, so two different nodes. So you can see here clearly with the arcuity graph that this is going to be actually here turtle1 cmd velforcommand velocity. So we have a topic turtle1 command velocity. And so the teleop turtle node is going to send some message, so it's going to publish some message to this topic. And the turtlesim node is going to subscribe. So it's going to receive messages from this topic. And this way this node can actually talk to that node. And you can see we have other topics. So I'm not going to give more details about this, but you can also see that this node, turtlesim is also sending messages to the teleop turtle. So you can have different topics and you can have even like a closed loop control if you want, between two nodes, okay? One node can send some data to the other node and this node can also send data to that one okay, so we can have like a closed loop control. But for now let's focus on that topic here. So this node is sending data to that node. If I do ROS2 topic list, I can see here turtle1 command velocity. So I can do ROS2 topic info turtle1/command velocity. And I can see I have one publisher, one subscriber. The publisher is that one. The subscriber is that one. The type of the data is this one. So I can do ROS2 interface show with the type. And I can see that this interface is actually a Vector 3. So that's another interface linear which contains X, Y and Z and angular which contains X, Y and z. So that's a common velocity to give a linear velocity following three axes and an angular velocity following also three axis. And so this is what is being sent actually from this node to that node. All right, so basically put a topic is a way to communicate between different nodes in your ROS application. Nodes actually don't directly talk to each other, they just publish or subscribe to a topic. You can have multiple nodes publishing on the same topic and multiple nodes subscribing to the same topic. So a topic has a name which is kind of actually the address of the topic. So the nodes know where to publish or where to subscribe. And they have a data type. So they also know what to send and what to receive. The topic mechanism is anonymous, which means that, for example, if a node is subscribing to a topic, it is just going to receive the messages from that topic. It doesn't know which node is publishing them. Alright, that's the end of this episode. If you found it useful, you will definitely like my full course on Rust 2 for beginners.

       " \"Welcome back. This is episode number seven of this tutorial series, Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. So now that you have a basic understanding of ROS topics, let's write a topic publisher in a Python node. So to create a Python node, the first thing is actually to create a Python file. So let's go Back to our ROS2 workspace source directory. My robot controller. My robot controller. In this we have found out what myfirstnode py let's actually make that a bit bigger. And what we can do is to create another one, let's say touch drawcycle py. So what we will want to do here is to control the turtle. So with the turtlesim node, we are going to control the turtle to make it draw a cycle. So we will not have to actually run the teleop key and press some keys on the keyboard. Everything is going to come from the code that we write. And I do chmode plus x. So now this is an executable. All right, let's go back to the source folder and let's do code dot and we can edit the file. So my first node, we don't need it anymore. This one for node. Now draw cycle and so let's just init the node. So first the interpreter user bin env python3 and we are going to import sclpy, okay? Also from sclpy node import node because we're going to use the node class and then let's do def main with args is none. Okay, so now I'm going to go just a bit faster because we have already actually created a node here. So make sure that you have correctly followed the previous lesson on how to create a node with object oriented programming. In the main function, let's do sclpy init with args is equal to args and then sclpy shutdown. Okay, so that's the first thing to do. Then if you want to also run the script from the terminal directly, you can add if name is equal to main call the main function. But I'm not going to do it here, so let's just keep it like this. Now I'm going to create a node so class let's name it simply draw cycle node which inherits from node. Let's create a constructor init self with super.init and let's call this node draw cycle. As you can see here, I use the same name for the node and for the file Just make sure that you know of course that this name is different from that name. Okay, Those are two different things. You can use the same name if you want, but this is the file name and. And this is the node name. And then maybe let's do self get logger dot info node so maybe draw cycle node has been started. Okay, I like to have a log usually in the constructor of the node so that you can see when you actually start the node that the node has been started and that it's running. Okay, so now we have initialized the node, we still don't have any publisher. So let's create a publisher. The publisher will allow us to send some messages to a topic. So how to create a publisher in Rust 2 with Python? Well, let's create it here. You can do for example self. So let's create an attribute. Let's call it command val pub like that. So cmd vel so command velocity pub is equal to self. So you can use self createpublisher. As simple as that. The self is the node. So the sclpy node and you create a publisher. Let's open and close parenthesis. And then what do you need to give? You need to give first the message type. How to know the message type? Well, we have seen that in the previous tutorial. Let's come back to the terminal and let's run. So let's. Well, let's run turtlesim here Ros to run turtlesim turtlesim node. Ok, so we have the turtle. Now let's reuse here the ros to topic list. You can see that this is the topic we want Turtle one command velocity. If we do rustopic info with that name. Now you can see we have the type. Okay, the type is geometry messages message twist. So that's what we need to send a twist message from the geometry Messages package. All right, so to do that I'm going to come back here and I'm going to do this here from Geometry Messages MSG import twist. And you can see we also have the auto completion because the geometry message is packaged. Okay, where is this package? Well, this one was actually installed when you installed ROS2 with your global installation. And I can put here twist. Now one very important thing is that because I'm using geometry Messages package in my robot controller package. So let's go to package XML and let's add a depend tag after sclp depend geometry msgs. Okay, so any package that you're going to use in my robot controller, you're going to Also add a dependency here in package xml. And by the way, I can also add turtlesim because for now we don't explicitly use turtlesim here in the code. We're going to do that later. But we actually need turtlesim to run because we're going to send some command to the turtle with the turtlesim package. So I also add dependency to turtlesim to make sure that actually when we run something in this package we have so the Python library, asil py, the geometry messages and the turtlesim packages. Let's save this. And that's pretty much it for the dependencies. Okay, so now I have the message type. Now I need to give the name of the topic. Okay, so a topic has a message type and a name. So what is the name? The name is that one turtle, one command velocity. So let's just use the same with quotes, okay? And make sure you use the exact same name. Okay? Any typo here and it's not gonna work. Okay, and finally I will add 10 here. So what is this? Well, this is a queue size. So you need to precise a queue size. So basically put, let's say that you are sending some messages on a topic in a network that is not that reliable or you are sending big pieces of data. The queue size will kind of create a buffer, okay, so that you can make sure that all the messages are going to be sent. And so the buffer here will contain 10 messages. So it's not really important for now. You just have to provide it. Let's just use 10 every time. And then when you get More advanced with ROS2, you can actually know more about this and use the settings that is going to work better for your application. All right, so create publisher with the data type and then the topic name and 10 for the queue size. So we have a publisher now. Well, this publisher will not do anything by itself. So we need to publish some data. And what we are going to do is. So let's say we want to send some data. So we want to control the turtle. We want to send some data every 0.5 seconds to give an instruction to move. So how to send some data every 0.5 seconds? Well, let's just use what we did before. Let's just use a timer with a callback. So let's do def. Let's create a callback, let's name it, for example, sendvelocity comment. So actually we just create a normal function and how to actually send something to the topic. So we have the publisher. But how to send something well, we will first need to create a message. So the message is equal to twist. So we use twist with open close parenthesis to create a message object from the class twist. And now we will need to fill this. So how to know what we need to send? Well, let's go back to the terminal and let's do Ros to interface show to see the inside of the interface. And now you can see we have vector three linear. So that's another type. So we have linear and then X, Y and Z. So we will have linear X, linear Y, linear Z and the same for angular, angular X, Y and Z. Now if we look at the turtle sim. So this message is actually 3D message, but here we are in 2D. So we will only be interested in a few of those. For example, the linear X. So the x axis here will depend on the turtle. Okay, so from the turtle going forward this is going to be X. Okay, Going perpendicular here, this is going to be Y. Okay, so if you send a linear X command, you're going to tell actually the turtle to move forward. So if it's positive and to go backward if it's negative. So that's the command we want. And then if you send an angular velocity, well, because this is 2D, the only angular velocity we can send is the Z axis. The Z axis is basically to turn on itself here. So by just sending X linear velocity, Z angular velocity, we will be able to make the turtle just turn around. Okay, I'm not going to go into more details about this. This is just mathematics. And here the most important is actually to understand how to use rust. Okay, so let's go to the code and let's do MSG dot and you can see here you have linear or angular. So we already have the auto completion with the twist. So let's do linear dot X is equal to. And let's use, well, let's use 2.0. That's the value I have tested before. You can also test different values if you want. And then let's do msg.angular.z is equal to 1.0. Great. So now we have created a message, we have filled the data of the message. So you don't necessarily need to fill all the fields. Okay. Just the one you want. Alright, so we have created the message and of course what we need to do is to publish the message. So how to publish the message? We do self.com and pub. So the publisher, we have created.publish and we pass the message. All right, so we create a publisher and Then we create a message and we use the publish method of the publisher to send the message. As simple as that. And now, well, this node is still doing nothing because it creates a publisher, it prints some log, but we are not publishing anything. So here I'm going to do self timer is equal to self create timer. I'm gonna give 0.5 seconds and the callback is self send velocity command. All right? So when the node is created, we're gonna create inside the node a publisher and then a timer print something. The timer is going to call this function every 0.5 seconds. And inside this function we create a message and we use the publisher that we have created here in the constructor to publish the message. So that's it for the node code. Now let's go back to the main. What do we have? We initialize Rust 2. We shut down Rust. Let's create the node draw cycle node and let's do rclpy spin with the node. That's it. We create the node and we make sure to of course, spin the node. If we don't make the node spin, well, we're just gonna exit the program right now. If we make the node spin, it is going to be kept alive and this timer will work every 0.5 seconds. So this is gonna be called thanks to the spin method here. So let's save this. And now let's go to setup PY to actually install the node. So how to install the node? Well, we're going to do the same thing as here in console script. We're going to add another line. So go after this one. Make sure you add a comma. That's very important. If you forget this comma, you will have some weird errors after that. And let's add another node. So another executable here, let's name it. Draw cycle is equal to my robot controller dot draw cycle, colon main. So what we have here, this is going to be the executable name. Draw cycle is equal to package name dot filename. Okay, you can see here the file name is also the same as the executable draw cycle and then colon main because we want to call the main function. All right, so let's save this as well. Let's go to the terminal and let's kill this. Let's go back to Rust to workspace and let's do callcon build. And I'm going to also do simlink install. So the simulink install will allow us, as you have seen before, it will allow us to modify this file Here and not having to build again to run the updated version of the node. And the thing is, we still have to actually use callcon build because, well, the first node, my first node, was already here, but drawcycle was not here. So when you create a new file and you create here a new executable, you need to do qualcomm build. The simlink install will only work for executables that are already created. Okay, so let's do this. Okay, finished. It was very quick. Now let's run the turtlesim node. Okay, so we have the turtlesim node. Nothing happens in that terminal. Let's do source bash sc. Okay, to make sure that we have set up the rust workspace environment and let's do rust. To run my robot controller, I'm going to press tab twice. You can see now we have two executables, Draw cycle and test node. So I'm going to run draw cycle and let's look at what's happening here. The turtle is drawing a cycle, okay? And it's cycling around. So if we want to debug this, let's do Clear. So if we want to do some introspection, let's do acuity graph and let's refresh here. And you can see we have our node named draw cycle. We have the turtle sim node. And the draw cycle is publishing to the Turtle one common velocity topic. The turtle sim is subscribing to this topic so that this node is actually sending data to that node. Great. Now let's say I kill the turtlesim. Okay, well, this draw cycle is still going to send some Data to the turtle 1 common velocity topic. But there is no subscriber, so nobody's going to receive it. I can start the turtlesim again. And you can see the turtle is going to continue to move if I. So let's put the turtle here. If I stop the draw cycle node, you can see the turtle is going to stop. I started again. The turtle is going to move and I stop. Okay, it stops. And so the very important thing here is that you need to pay attention to go back here. You need to pay attention to the type you're sending and the name. Okay? This is the most important thing. You use the exact same name and the exact same type, otherwise the communication is not going to work. And let's come back very quickly and let's run turtle again and the draw cycle. Okay, so it's working. And Here let's do ROS2 topic list. You can see we have common Velocity still here. ROS2 topic info with that one you can see now we have one publisher, one subscriber. If I do ROS2 topic eco with that topic you can also see what we receive. Okay so we receive some messages. I'm going to control C you can see we will receive some messages with linear x is equal to 2 and then we have 0 and 0 and then angular z is equal to 1. That's exactly what we are sending here. So if you want you can experiment with different values to make different cycle and well congratulation you have written your first Rust 2 publisher. All right, that's the end of this episode.

       " \"Welcome back. This is episode number eight of this tutorial series Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. In the last tutorial you have created a Python publisher. So now we are going to create the other side of the communication which is a subscriber. So in our python code we will be able to receive data from a topic. And now before we even start, we need to know what kind of data do we want to receive? What topic do we want to listen to? So I'm going to run the turtlesim so Ros to run turtlesim node again. Okay, we have this and if we do ROS2 topic list, let's see what do we want to receive. So here Common Velocity is actually to send data to the Turtle sim. The pose is actually published by the turtlesim node. So if I do acut graph. Okay, let's refresh. And if I uncheck those boxes here, Dead sinks and leaf topics you can see now. So we have the turtlesim node here which is subscribing to Common Velocity. But the Turtle SIM is also publishing Turtle one pose. So the pose is the current position. So pose is position and orientation. We have also other topics, but let's focus on that one. So for now the Turtle team is publishing to that topic, but there is no subscriber, so the messages are just not used. I can do e.g. rOS2 topic echo with the pose. Let's see what we get. You can see we have so we receive very fast messages with the x y theta position. Okay, so that's the x axis is going to be this one, the Y axis is going to be that one and the theta is going to be the orientation. So zero is looking forward here to the right. And we also have linear velocity and angular velocity. So let's say we want to create a subscriber to get the current x and Y position of the turtle in the window here. So we will need to subscribe to. Let's come back here to the turtle1post topic. Now we need more info. So let's do ROS2 topic info. So you see for now we have one publisher and you can see that this is the type Turtle SIM message pose. And we can do ROS2 interface show with this. And you can see inside we have float 32. So that's a float number X, Y theta and then linear velocity, angular velocity. That's actually what we have found also here. So now we have all the information we need. We have the name of the topic we want to subscribe to. We have the type and we know what's inside the message. Now we can start to write some code. So, well, let's actually kill that and let's go to our workspace again, My robot controller and my robot controller where we have all our Python files. Let's do touch. Just like that. Touch pose subscriber. Okay, let's keep things simple here. And chmod x pose subscriber. Great. Now let's go back to source repository and code dot to start Visual Studio code here. Okay, and we have this new file post subscriber. Now we can init. So let's init the file and the node. So user bin and Python 3 we will need as always to import sclpy and because we are going to create a node from sclpy node import node. Now let's create a main function. Args is equal to none. So I'm going to go Quite fast here. LCLPy init with args is equal to args and sclpy shutdown. Okay, and everything will be in between. So we have our main. Let's create a class. So how do we name this class? Well, let's do post subscriber node which inherits from node and def init. That's the constructor we call super.insit and we name the node also. Keep it simple. Post subscriber. Okay, so now we have the basic code for the node. What we want to do is to create a subscriber to a topic. So how to create a subscriber? So let's create an attribute here in the constructor. Self poscriber is equal to self. So it's quite easy to create a publisher. You do self createpublisher Here you do create subscription self createsubscription you open close parenthesis. And what do you need to give? First you need to give the message type. What kind of message do you expect to receive if we go back to the terminal in that one, you can see the interface is turtlesim message pose. So let's just include that. Let's do from turtlesim MSG import pose and we can put pose here. Note that because we use turtlesim we need to go to package XML and it's already here. So we already have the dependency. Nothing else to do. So great, we have the type and then, well, guess what? The topic name. What is the topic name? The topic name is that one. Turtle one. So with the slash turtle one. Pause here. Okay, let's actually Go back to a new line here so it's more readable. And then the third parameter here will be a callback. Okay, why a callback? Because actually when you create a subscriber, you're going to receive the messages and you want to process the messages when you receive them. So you're going to create a callback. So you're going to create a function that's going to act as a callback and that's going to be called every time you receive a message on that topic. So let's name this one pose callback with self. And we are also going to receive a message. Let's put msg and the message is going to be of type pose. So you can use that with Python to make it easier with colon pose to tell Python here that you're going to get a message as a pose object. So you can have auto completion here in the function. All right, and what are we going to do in the callback? So the callback is going to be called when we receive a message. So let's just print the message, let's do self, get logger with info and let's do str message. So just the string representation of the message and we will see later how to process it a bit more. But for now let's just print the message we receive. Okay, and in the create subscription we have so message, topic name and then the callback, self, pose, callback. And then I'm going to add 10 also as a queue size. So if you remember, that's kind of a buffer. So if you can't receive all the messages immediately, for example, if you have a lossy network or if the messages are too big, this is going to create kind of a buffer. So I'm just going to put it to 10 for now and forget about it. That's not very important at the beginning. All right, so quick recap. To create a subscriber, so you create attribute here in your node. You do self create subscription first with the data type, then the topic name, then a callback and a queue size for the callback. So what I usually do is I call it so what I'm going to receive underscore callback, so that it's easy to know that this function is actually a callback. And then in the callback you have one parameter which is the message you receive. And with a message you can do whatever you want. Now, in order to make this work, I will need to create the node here. So node is equal to pose subscriber, node and do sclpy spin node. That's very important because if you don't make the node spin, well, you're just going to create a subscriber. But then that's it. The node is going to be killed and rclpy shutdown with the spin, the node is going to be kept alive. And whenever you receive a message on that topic, this callback will be called thanks to the spinning functionality. Okay, so let's save this and let's try it. Let's actually install it. So let's go to setup py I'm going to add a comma here, new line. And let's do pose subscriber is equal to my robot controller pose subscriber colon main. So pos subscriber is going to be the executable name, then package name.file name, which is that 1 colon main main for the main function. And then inside the node name here is going to be also post subscriber. All right, so let's go back to the terminal and we will need to go back here to the roster workspace and do call con build. And I'm also going to put simlink install. Okay, so I'm building this new executable and with simulink install I can modify it and not having to build it again. So let's do source bash se, make sure that we source the environment. And let's do rust to run my robot controller with pose subscriber. Okay, so the node is running. We have actually nothing. Why is that? Because, well, we create a subscriber and we have a callback and we spin the node. That's it. So if we don't receive any message, well, nothing's gonna happen. But the node is still here. Now on this terminal, I'm gonna do rust to run turtlesim with turtlesim node. Let's put that here. Okay, we have the turtle here and you can see now we start to receive messages on the pose subscriber. Okay, we will receive a pose with x, y theta, linear velocity and angular velocity. Okay, because now this node is publishing to the topic pose. Let's check with arcuity graph. Let's actually refresh. Let's remove dead syncs and leave topics. So let's actually check the boxes. Now you can see the turtle sim is publishing to the Turtle one post and the post subscriber is subscribing to this. So it's just like the turtle sim node was sending messages to the post subscriber. So we can communicate between the two nodes. And now in this. So if I kill actually the turtle sim, you can see we stop receiving messages. If I start again, we start receiving messages again. And now in this terminal let's do rust to run my robot controller withdraw cycle. Now you can see the turtle is moving. And also here we will receive the pose. And you can see the X, Y and theta are also moving. Why is that? So let's actually restart RQT graph and let's refresh. You can see now we have the draw cycle which is publishing something to the common velocity, which is then received by the Turtle sim. And then the Turtle sim is publishing on the pose topic and the pose subscriber is subscribing to the pose topic. So when the draw cycle is sending some comment, the turtle sim is going to move the turtle and is also going to update the pose so that the post subscriber is going to receive new updated data. And let's come back to the code here. Actually, so we just print found out the string representation of the message. But let's say we want to actually do more stuff and get the fields of the message. So we can do that. For example, let's actually modify the way we print. Let's just print X and y with a nice syntax. So let's put the parenthesis and then str with message dot and we can get access for example to message X. Okay, and then plus let's put a comma plus str message y. Then plus let's finish with a parenthesis. Okay, so you can access each attribute, so each field inside the message. And then. Well, I just printed this, but you can do whatever you want. Okay. You can update an attribute in the class. You can decide to call different functions depending on what you receive, etc. So now let's save this and let's actually go back here. I'm going to kill this node. I'm going to source the bash SC and I'm going to do Rust too. So I'm just going to run the node again. You can see now we receive not just the complete message, but X and Y. So the total is still moving. Yes. And so we receive X and Y just like that, with parenthesis. All right. And you have created your first Rust 2 subscriber. All right, that's the end of this episode. If you found it useful, you will definitely like my full course on Rust 2 for beginners.

       " \"Welcome back to episode number nine of this tutorial series, Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description and let's get started. As for now, in this tutorial series, we have created one publisher in one node and one subscriber in another node. But we can do better than that. We can create one node which is going to contain both a subscriber and a publisher. And in this particular case, with the turtle team, what we are going to do is to create a closed loop system for the turtle. So first of all, let me show you what we are going to do and what topics we are going to use for this closed loop control. Let's run so rust to run turtlesim with turtlesim node. Okay, we have the turtle and then let's do RQT graph. Okay, so we have just the turtle. Let's actually uncheck dead sinks and leaf topics so we can see all the topics even if there is no publisher or there is no subscriber. And now what do we want to do? Well, we want to control the turtle sim with a closed loop control. So we want to control actually the turtle in the turtle sim node. What we will need to have, we need to have actually the pose of the turtle to know where the turtle is. And we will need to send commands to actually this topic command velocity. So we will create a node somewhere here that's going to subscribe to the pose and publish to the command velocity. And this node is going to monitor the pose. So receive current position and send an appropriate comment depending on what it has received from the position. Okay, so the loop will be like this closed loop control like that. And basically what we're going to do in this controller is we're going to say to the turtle, just move forward. And then we are going to define some borders which are not so not this border and not that border, but a bit before so that the turtle can actually turn around when it gets closer to the edge of the window. Turn around and continue to move, for example, like this, and then turn around, continue to move, etc. So that the turtle can continuously move forward and turn around when it gets closer to any of the edges of the window. All right, so now that we know what we want to do, let's actually kill the node and kill acuity graph. Okay, and let's now create a new file. So we are going to go to our workspace source folder. My robot controller. My robot controller. We have already three python files. Let's create another one. Touch. Let's do Turtle Controller py and then let's actually put this here chmod plus x with Turtle controller. Okay, now let's go back to our source folder and let's do code to start Visual Studio code in the source folder of our workspace. So we don't need this anymore. Okay, and now let's edit the total controller Python. So first things first, let's initialize the node and the file so that we've already seen several times. So interpreter with Python 3 and then let's import sclpy. Let's import so from sclpy node import node. We are going to create a main function with args none. So that's going to be the same all the time. All right, LCLPy init with args = then SCLPy shutdown. Okay, I'm not going to create if name is equal to main so I'm not going to do like my first node here because we're not going to launch directly the file, we're going to install it. So I just need a main function. Okay, let's create a node. Let's name it Turtle controller node which inherits from node and then def init self we will need to call super.init and let's give it a name total control. Okay, let's keep things simple and then maybe do self get logger with info Turtle controller has been started. Okay, now let's complete the main node is equal to Turtle controller node and then sclpy spin with the node and that's it for the initialization. Actually we can also let's save and let's install it directly. So we add a comma here and then Turtle controller is equal to my robot controller dot Turtle controller with a colon and main and let's save it. Okay, now let's go back to the terminal. Let's go back to our rust workspace and let's do colcon build simlink install. Good. Now let's do source bash SE and rust to run to see if we correctly initialize the node with Turtle controller and yes, we can find it. Turtle controller has been started. Now the node is spinning control C2 quit. All right, and let's now start the control of the turtle. So we will need to create a publisher to the command velocity topic and we will need to create a subscriber to the pose topic. And actually how we are going to manage things is that we are not going to. So let's see what we did in draw cycle. In draw cycle, if you remember we created a publisher to the common velocity topic and then with a timer that was Running here every 0.5 seconds we were publishing some velocity. But we are not going to create a timer here. What we are going to do is we are going to create a subscriber to the pose topic and in the subscriber callback we are going to publish actually to the comment velocity. Okay? So whenever we receive a pose, we publish a new comment. So let's start actually with the subscriber and we're going to create a subscriber. So we actually already know what we need to do here. I'm going to go back to the terminal to find the name and the type. You can see the name is turtle one pose and the type is turtlesimpose. So let's do from turtlesim MSG import pose. And then let's create a. So pose subscriber is equal to self create subscription and the type is going to be pose. Actually let's go back to a new line here. And then the name is going to be. Let's just use the same name. Exactly. Okay, Total one pose and then we need the callback. So let's create def pose callback with self because we're in a class. And then pose. So we could put msg, but I can also put pose the same with colon and then pose so that we say that this is a pose data type which is going to help for the autocompletion. For now let's just use pass. Okay, let's keep the function empty and let's put it there. Self, pose, callback and then 10 for the queue size. All right, so self, create subscription message, type the topic name, the callback and then queue size. And just like this, the subscriber should work because well, we have subscriber a callback and we are spinning the node. Now let's create the publisher. So I'm going to create a publisher here before the subscriber. Self. So command. Well, publisher is equal to self create publisher. What message do we need? So let's actually go back to draw cycle where we actually did the same thing. We need a twist message from geometry messages. And the name of the topic is total 1 command velocity. So let's do that from geometrymessages msg import twist. I'm going to put twist here. Twist. Actually, let's also go back to a new line for readability. The topic name is turtle1 command velocity written like this. And then let's put 10 as the cue size. Good. So we have created a publisher and a subscriber. Now what do we need to do? We need to publish something new when we receive a pose. So here we need to check actually what is the current pose of the turtle? And depending on the pose, we may send different comments. But just to try, just to try and to make sure that we are actually sending some comments when we receive a pose, let's just send a very basic and stupid comment to the turtle. Just to check that. Just to check that our code is working and that the callback is working. Okay, step by step. When we are sure that this is working, then we can think about what's the best way to control the robot. Okay, so let's actually create a comment. So I'm going to use command is equal to twist. Okay, we receive a pose here, and we're going to create a command that is actually a twist. All right, and now in the twist, what do we have? So let's do command dot. We have angular and we have linear. So for this first step, let's say that we just want to make the turtle go forward, even if it hits the wall or the edge of the window. That's okay. We just want to make it go forward. So I'm going to do command linear X is equal to. And let's use 5.0 as a velocity. And then command angular Z is equal to 0.0. I'm going to leave the other 1 to 0. So no y and Z linear and no X and Y angular. I'm just going to focus on the X linear and the Z angular. Like I explained before when we did the draw cycle node. So we have a twist command. Now I can do self.com, publish with the comment. Okay, so here we don't use the pose yet, but we just publish when we actually receive a pose. So in the subscriber callback. Okay, so this should be. Okay, let's save the file and let's go back to the terminal. I'm gonna move it like this. Okay, clear. Let's actually do CD and source the bash rc So I don't need to build anymore because I've used symlink install. Let's just make sure that we source the bash SE and okay, in this terminal, let's do rust to run turtle sim turtlesim node. Okay, we have the turtle right there. And in that one, let's run the controller. So Rust to run my robot controller, Turtle controller. And now let's look very closely at what's gonna happen to the turtle. Here I Press enter and okay, the turtle is moving forward and then hitting the wall. Okay, and you can see I hit the wall, etc. So the thing is that it's working. It is doing exactly what we want it to do, which is that when we receive a pose. So here with the pose callback, we send a command to go forward. So that's exactly what the turtle is doing. And that's already a good progress in this application. So now what we want to do is we want of course, to not make the turtle hit the wall, but to actually, let's say to turn around when it gets closer to the wall and then come back and continue and, and just continue to move indefinitely. And so to do that we will need to know what are the coordinates. And so I'm going to show you very quickly what are the coordinates. Let's just kill everything. Let's start the turtlesim again. And here I'm going to start the teleop. So Rust 2 Run Turtlesim turtle Tillyup key so that I can move the turtle. And when we move the turtle, we also want to know what are the coordinates of the turtle. And so to get the coordinates, well, here let's do clear and let's do ROS2 topic list. We have the pose that we can subscribe to. And in the pose you have the X and the Y. But also if you remember, what did we do before we did a pose subscriber. And in this pose subscriber node, we actually filter the pose to just bring the X and the Y coordinates, which is basically what we want to know right now. So I'm going to use this instead, Ros to run my robot controller with pose subscriber. Good. And you can see we have the X here and the Y. And so what you can see is that the turtle is now in the middle at about 5.5 and 5.5. So 5.5 on the x axis, 5.5 on the y axis. Now let's move the total. So let's make it go forward and hit the wall. You can see now we are at 11. So just about 11 on the X axis. And we are still at 5.5 on the Y axis. Okay, so let's go to the upper right part. Okay, we are at 11 and 11 and let's go to the other diagonal. Okay, so let's go to the bottom right. Let's focus here. Okay, and we should reach zero and zero. Yes. Okay, so you can see I'm going to stop this one. You can see that in this window, we start at 0, 0 here. And then on the X axis, we go until 11. On the Y axis, we go until 11. So we know what are the coordinates that the turtle can reach. And so what we could say now is that if the turtle is close to the border, let's say by two. So if the turtle reaches, for example, X, which is nine or more, then it should turn around. Then we can do the same with Y is more than nine. We could do the same with X is lower than 2. And we could also do the same with Y is lower than 2. So we can make sure that we actually kind of draw the square inside the square. This is going to be the safe square where the turtle can just move forward. And when the turtle goes outside of this, which is closer to the actual border of the window, then we make the turtle turn around. Okay, so again, let's do step by step. Let's first. So let's actually start the turtle scene and let's imagine the current scenario. So the turtle is going forward, okay? And let's just make it turn when it reaches this wall on the right. And that's it. All right, so let's stop this and let's stop that and clear everything and let's go back to the code. So we are going to improve this pose callback. And here we will need to use actually the pose, okay, we will need to use the current position of the turtle. So what I could do here is to check that if pose X, okay, we have the X coordinate is greater than nine. So greater or greater or equal, it doesn't really matter here. So if the X coordinate is greater than nine, what do we do? We make the turtle move in a circular way, maybe. Let's actually create the comment first and then check this. So let's do command dot linear and let's also make the total go slower. So I'm going to use linear X is 1.0 and then comment. Angular.Z is equal to 0.9. So why those values? Well, those are values that I've tried before actually and that I know are working. So if you want, you can just start with those values and then increase a bit X or Z velocity or decrease them all, right? To find something that works. But by doing this, you can see here we move at 5. So the speed is 5 for the x linear here, the speed is 1. So it's going to go slower and it's also going to turn on the Z axis. And so if the pose is greater than nine, we do this, but then we need to do also else. And I'm going to put this in the else. So we only go forward if the pose. So if the X pose is not greater than nine. All right, so we have two different commands depending on the current pose, and then we of course publish the command. Let's save this and let's see what we have. Source bash SE here. Let's run the Turtle sim and let's run our controller. So not Post subscriber, but TurtleController. OK, good. You can see it's turning and then it's going again. And of course it's going to hit the wall because we haven't specified what to do if the x is lower than 2. So as you can see here, the turtle was going forward because the X is lower than 9. When x reaches 9, we change the comment. So instead of going to 5 speed on the x axis, we go to 1 and then we also add an angular velocity. So the turtle is going to turn to turn until. Well, actually until the X pose is lower than 9. And in that case we just continue to go forward. So now what we need to do is we need to handle the case for the left part, for the top part, and for the bottom part. And that's gonna be actually quite easy. So we can say if the pose is greater than 9, or the pose x is lower than 2, or the pose y is greater than 9, or the pose y is lower than 2, and that's it. Okay, so if we do this, if we check that actually the turtle is close to the wall. Okay, so either the X or the y is lower than 2 or the x or the y is greater than 9. In this case, we made the turtle rotate, otherwise we just continue to go straight. Let's save this, go back here. Let's kill this one. Source Bash LC let's start the Turtle sim node again and the controller again and let's see what's going to happen. Okay, we turn here and then go straight and then we turn and then go out of this. Let's turn and you can see it's turning again. So here it's hitting the wall a bit, but that, that's okay. Okay, and we turn again, etc. So for example here, so I'm going to stop the controller and you can see when I stop the controller, well, the turtle just stops moving. So you can see here we hit the wall. And if you want to avoid that, you may want to actually increase the angular Z velocity here. But if you Do. So, for example, I'm going to do 1.5. Okay. And let's see what's happening. So let's start the Turtle sim and then source the Bash SC and the turtle controller. Okay. What may happen is that the turtle at some point. So let's wait a bit. Okay, you can see this behavior is that the turtle is actually going to be stuck because if it turns too fast, it may stay over the limit. And the limit here is Y9. So the turtle is over the limit and is stuck. So that's why I have actually reduced the angular Z to 0.9, because that's a value I found that works. You could go down even to, for example, 0.8 or 0.7. And that's okay. Even if the total hits the wall at some point, that's really not a problem. Okay, we are experimenting with ROS2 here. That's just a simulation. All right, so let's run it again. Actually. So let's kill this and then do source BASH sc. Run the controller. So we can start to run the controller actually before the turtlestream. No, it doesn't matter because it's only gonna wait for the pause and then send some comments. So nothing's gonna happen until we start the turtles in node. So let's wait. Going to wait maybe one minute and show you what it's going to do. Well, and as you can see, the turtle is continuously moving and turning when it reaches the edges. All right, so everything is working correctly. And let's just run Acuity graph to finish here. And now we can remove dead sinks and leave topics. And you can see we have our closed loop control. So we have the turtle sim here and the turtle controller node. And you can see the turtle controller is listening to the pose and then sending data to the command velocity. So we have a closed loop control here. All right, that's the end of this episode.

       " \"Welcome back. This is episode number 10 of this tutorial series, Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description and let's get started. So in this tutorial you are going to understand what are ROS2 services and to understand what are services, let's start with the problem. So let's say you have different nodes and you want an interaction that is kind of a client server. So, so you want a node to act as a client. So it's going to send a request to a node with a server and then the server is going to process stuff and reply to the client. And this kind of interaction, well, is not really what topics are made for. Okay, with a topic, as you have seen, you send some data from one point to another point, but you don't get an answer. Okay, we can do a closed loop system, but you can't have this client server architecture with a request and a response. And so that's why we have ROS services. So let's run a few services and you will quickly understand and then everything will make more sense. So in this terminal I'm going to run so rust two run demo nodes, cpp. Let's come back to this package. And here we have add to int server. Let's run that. So when I run it, nothing happens. You can see I press enter. The node is just waiting. This is a node where we will have a service. Now if I do RQT graph, the thing is, with RQT graph you can't see services. Okay, you can see nodes and topics, but you can't see services. So RQT graph will not be useful for services. But we also have ROS2 service. So we have the ROS2 topic command for topics and we have ROS2 service for services. And you have ROS to service list. And you can see we have add to int service. So a service will have a name, just like a topic. A topic has a name and a type, while a service will also have a name and a type. And here you have what you have stuff that is specific to the node. Add to INTS server. Okay, so if I do rust to node list, you can see we have add to int server node and for each node you will have a set of services. But we don't really care about those. What we want is this one add to int service. And so how to get more info about this service? Well, ROS2 service and then you can see we have actually type. Okay, so when I press tab I can see type and this so you can see that the type for the service is example interfaces SRV for service, add to ints. So how can I see what's inside? Ros to interface show. So just like we did for messages with topics, we can do Ros to interface show for services. And let's put this. And you can see we have that. So that's a bit different. So we have something. We have int A and int B. And then we have dash, dash, dash and then int sum. All right, so this here, before the three dashes, this is the request that you're going to send. And after the three dashes, this is the response that you're going to get. So this node add to int server contains a server, so contains a service server named add to ints. Now, in order to call this service, you need to send a request that is this one int A int B. And after you call the server, the server is going to process stuff and it's going to return a response which contains the send. So let's actually try this. We can do ROS2 service. So we can call a service actually from the terminal. We can create a client from the terminal. So ROS2 service call and then the service name, add to ints. And then let's press tab twice. We need to provide the type. So ROS2 service call with the name, with the type. And then if I press tab again, well, you can see we have weird stuff. But what I can do is use actually curly brackets. So let's use curly brackets here and let's put a like that, for example, is equal to 2, and then B with 5. Okay, so you can use curly brackets. And then the field A, you can put A with quotes colon the value you want, create an integer. So you put 2 comma and then do that for every field I'm going to press enter. So look what's going to happen here. I press enter here and actually. Well, actually, no, I need to do. So let's change this. Let's use double quotes around the curly brackets and then single quotes inside. I think this is going to work. And yes, this is working. So, yes, if you want to call Ros to service, call from the terminal, make sure you use that syntax. And. Well, that's kind of tricky even I forgot how it was working. But yeah, double quotes, curly brackets, and then fields with single quotes inside. So what's happening? You can see making requests with a is equal to 2 and b is equal to 5. That's what we want. And then the response with sum is equal to 7. Let's look at the server side. We have a log incoming request with 2 and 5. So the request was sent from the client key to the server. The server printed this log incoming request, processed the request, and then returned a response with the sum. And you can see this happens almost instantly. Let's try again. Let's modify. Let's put nine and you can see it's working too. We have some 11 and here we will receive two and nine. All right, so you can see that a service is simply, well, a client server communication. And for a service you can have, well, only one server. Get the servers here in this node. But you can have many clients. Okay, I could call the service from this terminal, I could call it from another node. So I can have as many clients as I want. As an analogy, let's say you have a web server. So the web server for a specific URL, for example, we only have one. If you go to example.com there is only one server. On example.com there is only one URL, but you can have as many clients as you want connecting to the server. Okay, so with a service, you have one server and as many clients as you want. And then we're going to use services for mainly two kinds of requests. Either a computation. So that's what we did. We send some data in the request and we expect something in the response that's a computation related to the request. And the second type of service is actually not a computation, but a change of settings. So in your robot you may have a lot of settings and you can use some services to be able to change the settings. So you will have a service server where you want to change the settings. And then other nodes can create some requests to change the setting. And actually let's try that with the turtle sim. So I'm going to just clear all of that. Let's kill this and clear. Let's run. So rust to rust to run total sim, total SIM node. Okay, I have the node here. Let's actually put this on the side and let's do rust to service list. As you can see, we have quite a few services. So we have services that are related to the node turtlesim here. So we don't really worry about those. But then we have a bunch of services, for example, clear. So if you call clear, it's going to clear all the traces that the pen has left on the window kill. You can actually kill a turtle. So you could remove this turtle reset, I think is going to reset the turtle to the center and then spawn, you could spawn another turtle. So you will have turtle two, turtle three, etc. And then, well, here the one we're going to use is turtle one set pen. Okay, so as you know, the trace that the turtle leaves is going to be white or light gray. So that's what we call the pen. Okay, let's do ROS 2 Run Turtle Sim with turtle tiliope key. And when I move, you can see. Well, it's kind of light gray. Right? But we can change the color of this. We can change with set pane. So that's an example of how to change a setting. The service server is hosted on the turtlesim node. And then we can call this from another node or even from the terminal. So let's do ROS2 service type with setband to know what we need to send. Okay, we need to send turtlesim service setpan. Now let's do ROS2 interface show with that. And what do we have here? Well, we have a request with rgb. So right, green, blue and then the width of the pane and off. If you want to turn off the pane, that's the request. Then we have. And you can see after dash, dash, dash, we have nothing because, well, there is a response, but the response is going to be empty. So it's possible that you create a service with an empty request or an empty response. No problem with that. So let's call this service to actually change the color. Okay, let's do ROS 2 service call with turtle 1. Turtle 1 set pane with the turtle SIM service set pen service. And then let's use double quotes, curly brackets. And then R will be. So here we need to give a number between 0 and 255. So let's say we want to change the color to red. I'm going to do it simple. Let's do 255. And then G is going to be zero and then B is going to be zero as well. The width, so width. Let's try. I don't know, let's try with three and off. Off should be zero. Okay, let's press enter. You can see. So we have nothing on the logs of the total SIM node. Why is that? Because simply. Well, the server didn't print any log, but you can see it was working because we have a response. So we have an empty response. Because if you remember well, in the interface we don't have any response. So we still have one that is empty. And now let's try to move the Turtle and you can see now it's red. So the pen has changed to a red pen and the width is 3. So I guess that the width was 3 before. So that's the same one. Let's actually change it. So let's send another request with six and then I don't know, let's put red to zero, green to 100 and blue to 100. Okay, and let's move the turtle again and you can see now we have another trace that's a bit thicker. And so here. Well, as you can see we have called the service from the terminal and this is not that convenient. If the service starts to be quite big. Okay, if the request actually starts to be quite big, this is not going to be convenient. But actually, of course later on we are not going to call the service from the terminal. That's just for debugging and testing. We are going to call it from the code directly. That's what we're going to see just later. And one more thing is that. So let's say kill the turtle sim here and. Well, I don't need that as well. Let's try to call the service and you can see waiting for service to become available. Okay, because the service, If I do ROS 2 service list while the service is listed here because we are calling it. But let's do that again. We don't have any service. So if we try to call a service that doesn't exist, well, it is going to wait. Okay, maybe you will get an error, but here it's waiting. If I start the turtlesim then you can see the service is going to be up and then the request can be made. Alright, so you have seen an overview of services through two different examples. And so you are going to use a service when you need a client server kind of interaction and when to use a service versus a topic. Well, topics are going to be used to send some data streams. So if you need to send some data from one part to another part without expecting an answer, just sending some data, e.g. sensor data, command velocity data, this kind of data stream will be handled by topics. But when you need to make some interaction where you're going to, for example compute something or change a setting and you expect also an answer, then you are going to use services.

       " \"Welcome back to episode number 11 of this tutorial series Crash Course on ROS2. You can find the series playlist in the description. And let's get started. So in this tutorial we are going to create a service client with python. And to see what we need to do, let's actually come back to the application with the turtle controller that we have. So let's run so Ros to run turtle sim with turtlesim node. Okay. We have the turtle here and then we have the controller Ros to run turtle. No, actually my package, my robot controller with turtle controller. So for now what we have is the turtle is correctly controlled to move around and not hit the wall. What we want to do is we want to kind of split the screen in two and say that on the right we want the color to be, let's say. And on the left we want the color to be green. So the color of the pin. All right. So we wouldn't want to modify the color depending on if the turtle is on the right side or on the left side. And how can we do this? Well, ROS2 service list we have just actually used. So this one, the Turtle one set pan service. So we have just used this one in the previous tutorial to explain what our services. And so that's the one we are actually going to code. So we are going to call a service client inside our turtle controller so that we can modify the color of the pen depending on where the turtle is. Okay, so let's actually do that. I don't need to create any new node or anything. I can just go back to. So let's go to the source folder of the routes to workspace and let's do code dot and let's go back to the code. So the turtle controller here. And so that's where I am going to create the service call. And where are we going to create the service call actually? Well, we are going to call the service from the pose callback. Okay. Because we need to call the service depending on where the turtle is. If the turtle is on the right of the screen, which means that actually the pose X is greater than 5.5, which is the middle. Then we're going to choose the color red. If it's on the left side, we choose the color green. And so we will need to call the service. So to create a client with a request in the post callback. Okay. And to do that I'm going to create a new function here, a new method in the class def call set then service. Okay. Because we will have a few lines of code to do that. So I'm going to create a method that is specific just to call the service. Okay, let's do self and then let's put all the parameters we need. So rgb width of. Okay, how do I know that? Because if you do rush to service type with the set pen. Okay, why do I have nothing? Okay, because. Well, the service actually doesn't exist. I need to run ros to run turtlesim turtlesim node then this should be better and ros to interface show with that we have rgb with and off. So those are the five parameters of the request. I create a function and I just send this as the parameters. And then what do we need to do? Well, we need to create a client in the code. So client is equal to self. So self is the node create client. As simple as that. What do we need to provide? We need to provide the service type. What is the service type? The service type is turtlesim SRV setpen So we are going to do from so from turtlesim srv okay, we did MSG for messages for topic and here for service we do srv import set pen. Now we need to make sure that we have the dependency to turtle sim. But we already added it before. Okay, in the package XML we have turtlesim so everything is good. So I have setpen that I can put here setpen and then we need to provide a service name. Alright, so very similar as for topics. For topics we need to provide the type and the name. Here we need to provide the type and the name. What is the name? The exact name is this with quotes it's going to be better. Okay, and that's it for the creation of the client. So now we have a client but. Well, actually we have nothing. We just have an object representing the client. What we will do is we will say, let's say we want to wait for the service. Okay, we don't want to call the service if the service is not up. Because if you call the service and the service is not up, well you're going to have an error here. I'm going to do while not client wait for service. So you have this waitforservice method in the client here that you use with CreateClient. And we need to provide a timeout, let's say one second. And here we're going to do self getlogger. We're going to log something and instead of info I'm going to use one. Okay? One is going to print something with the yellow Color and let's say waiting for service. So we do wait for service for one second if the service is up. So this is just going to return immediately and we can continue. But if the service is not up after one second, we are going to print waiting for service, etc. Etc. Until the service is up. All right, now we have a client, we know the service is up. What we can do, we can create a request. So let's do request is equal to set then dot request. So actually request with an uppercase and open close parenthesis. And then we are going to fill the request. So request.r is equal to R. Okay, that's going to be what we get from the parameter here. And then request.g is equal to G. Request B is equal to B. Request dot WITH all right, and the last one, request authentic is equal to off. So we just repeat the parameters inside the request. Nothing really fancy here. And then, well, we're gonna call the service. Okay, we have the client, the services up, we have the request. Now we can call the service. So we can do client call async. So this will call the service in an asynchronous way. What does it mean? It means that it's gonna return immediately. If you call it just with the call like this, it's going to call the service and then wait. So block right here until the service has replied. But if you do that, you may have some problems with the different threads. Okay, with the spinning, and I'm not going to go into much details here, but if you block the thread that's calling the service, you may have some errors, for example, that the response is never received. So I'm going to call async and I need to send a request. So client dot call async request. This is actually going to give me a future object. Okay, so we are going to work with future. And also I'm not going to go into much detail about future, but basically a future is something that's going to be done in the future, basically. So you can work on this future, you can add a callback so that when you actually get the response from the service, then the future is going to call this callback and you can process the request and that's what we're going to do. So I'm going to add here a callback, def callback, let's call it callbacksetpen self and also future here. So that's how to write the code. So here I'm showing you how to write the code. It may sound A bit complicated for a service, but the thing is that it's always going to be the same thing. So the first time you write the service client, it's a bit difficult, but then you're going to write it a second time, a third time, and then you're going to have written it 10 times, 20 times, and it's going to be super easy at the end. So here in this function, let's do pass for now. And that's going to be the callback for when the service replies with the response. Okay, we call the service, we send the request asynchronously so that this method is going to return. And then we need to add a callback for that. And to add a callback for that, I'm going to do future add Don callback and here I'm gonna use partial with self callback set pin. So I provide a callback here and partial is not found, you need to import it. So from functools import partial. That's one thing you need to import. Okay, with Python functools and partial, then we put future add Don callback with partial self callback set pane. And this is going to call this method when the service has replied. And in this what we do is we do response is equal to future. So that's the future we get here dot results. Also, I'm going to add this inside a try and accept block because we might have a service exception. I'm just going to accept exception as e. And if I get an exception I can do self get logger. And here I'm going to use error. Okay, so that's yet another level of logs. Okay, we have info one and error. And I can say service call failed. And I'm going to use this syntax with R here and then percentage e comma inside parenthesis. So that's a specific syntax, but that's just how you can print an exception easily here with ROS2 services. All right, and now the service call is complete. So to recap quickly here we create a client. With self create client we set the type and the name of the service. Then what you can do is you can also wait for service to make sure that the service is available. Then you create a request. You do client callasync to send the request to the server. And this is going to give you a future object. Then you can add a callback with future add don callback and partial you can add a callback so that the callback is going to call when the service replies. When the service replies, you need to do a try except block so that you can manage the exception if you get an exception. Okay, so if the service could not be correctly handled by ROS2 or if, I don't know, if anything bad happens, then you're gonna get an exception. And you can print the exception with this syntax. And if everything works correctly, then by doing future result, you're gonna get the response. And here I do nothing with the response. Why is that? Because here with ROS to interface show, you can see that we have this for the request and then. And we have nothing in the response. So if you add something in the response, for example, with the add to int server that we have used previously, you could for example do response.Sum and that would be something you can use in this node class. Okay? You could use it to do whatever you want. You can process the response and do anything else you want. All right, so now we have the syntax for the service call. And this, well, basically this is going to be almost the same every time you call a Service inside a ROS2 Python node. Now, well, let's actually call this service because we have method, but we don't use that method. Where are we going to use it? Well, we're going to use it in the pose callback. So what do we do in the pose callback? We get. So yeah, we get the pose and then depending on the pose we send a different comment. We're not going to change that, but after we do this, we're going to also check where is the turtle. So depending on the X property of the pose, we're going to change the color of the pen. So for example, if X is greater than 5.5, so actually POS x so we know that the Middle point is 5.5. So everything on the right of the window will be more than 5.5. Everything on the left will be less than 5.5. So if it's more than 5.5, what we can do is to do self call set pen service with. So we want it to be red. So let's do 25500 and then with, let's put three and off, let's put zero and then else self call setpence service with zero. So 255 for the green 030. All right, so right side of the screen, right, left side of the screen green. As simple as that. And maybe we can also add a log self.get logger.info set color to red and let's do the same Here, self get logger dot info, set color to green. All right, so we know when we send the request. Actually, if you want, you could also add some logs in the call setband service and also in the callback. So in the try block to see when you get the response, when you send the request, etc. Good. So this should work. But I'm going to add something else because, well, now the question is how frequently this is going to happen. For now, we didn't really worry about that, but now we should. Why is that? Because, well, when you publish on a topic, you can publish at very high frequencies. For example, 100 hertz, 1,000 hertz. That could work. Also even a few thousand hertz, sometimes you have some topics that are published very, very frequently. But for services, a service is not made to be called 100 times per second. Okay. A service is made so that it's called when you need to call it in a punctual way. So it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't call a service 10 times per second. But the best way to handle services is just to call them when you need to. Otherwise it can really slow down the application. So let's find out. So what do we need to find out? We need to find out how frequently we get the pose. And this we can use with another command. So we have turtlesim is running here, ROS2 topic list. We have the pose. How frequently do we receive a pose? Well, that's a good question. And we can get this with ROS2 topic Hz for Hertz. That's going to give us the frequency of the topic. Let's do this. And it's gonna. Okay, it's gonna listen to the topic. So let's wait a bit and let's do control T. It's gonna listen to the topic and then publish the average rate, which give you an idea of how frequently you get some messages on that topic. And you can see we have about 60 messages per second. So 60 hertz, which means that this callback is called 60 times per second. We publish a command 60 times per second, and with this code we would call the service 60 times per second. So for a publisher, 60 Hz is good for a service you don't want to call a service 60 times per second. So what can we do to solve that? Well, it's quite simple. We can. So let's use the turtle here. We can keep track of the X position and we can actually just change the color when the turtle crosses the middle. Okay, so when the Turtle goes from left to right or when the turtle goes from right to left, we don't need to change it when the turtle is left and that stays left. Okay, the color is going to be the same. Okay, we need to change it when the turtle crosses the middle. So we have two cases here. When the x position is lower than 5.5 and then the x position is greater than 5.5, or when the x position is greater than 5.5, and then the x position goes to lower than 5.5. So let's create. Well, let's do that quite quickly, but let's create here self previews X and let's just put zero as an initialization value. Okay, and we're going to do if. So if the pose is greater than 5.5 and self previous x is lower or equal than 5.5. Okay, so it means that before the total was on the left and now the total is on the right, then we change to red and then else I'm going to add else if. Actually, so not else if. But Elif with Python pose is lower than 5.5. Actually, let's use lower or equal here and self previous X greater strictly than 5.5. So this means that it was previously on the right side and now it is on the left side. And then we want to change the color to green. And of course we need to do self previous X is equal to pose X here. And also here self previous X is equal to pose X. So that's a. Well, that's a very quick way to solve this issue. Maybe there are different logical ways to do that. But this is quick and easy and that's going to be enough for this tutorial. So we initialize the previous X to 0. It doesn't really matter. And then when we go from left to right, we set the color to red. We also save the previous X and we do the same when we go to the other side so that if we stay on the same side of the screen. Okay, so if we stay on the left, we are not going to call the service. If we stay on the right, we are not going to call the service. Only when we cross the middle. Okay, I'm gonna save this and this should be it. So actually, let's find out and let's try. That's the only way to know. And let's. So let's kill everything here. Clear. Let's do source bash sc, because I'm gonna run the script from there, I'm gonna run the controller from there. Here, let's do Rust to run turtlesim with turtlesim node. Okay, here we don't need that screen and let's run so Rust to run my robot controller with Turtle controller. Let's see what happens. Okay, and we have an error, which is this is not supported between instances of pose and float. Let's find out with the code. Yes, actually it's pose X. I forgot the X. Of course, I can't compare a pose with a number because that's something that's different. Let's try again. So let's run this and let's try this again with source bash LC and run the controller. Okay, you can see it's red and then it crosses the line and it's green. And we have a log too. It crosses the line and it's red. And you can see set color to red and then set color to green. All right. And then again and again. I'm gonna leave it just a bit so you can see what's gonna happen at the end. Okay, great. You can see it's working quite well. The turtle continues to move, tries to avoid hitting the wall, and whenever it crosses the middle line, it changes color. So you can see everything on the right is red, everything on the left is green. So everything is working as expected and well. Congratulations. You have just written a service client with Python. You have also mixed it with some publishers and some subscribers in just one node. So you have already a complete Rust 2 application. Hey, it's Eduard. I hope you enjoyed this crash course and that you found it useful. Now, if you want to continue to learn Rust 2 with a full and in depth course covering everything about the Rust concepts, Python and C code and also more practice activities. Well, I have the course just for you. This Rusto course contains more than 10 hours of structured video content and also downloadable code for each activity and project. You will dive into the ROS concepts with much more details and also discover ROS parameters, launch files, how to write service servers and many other things.
